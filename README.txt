Description
This vacation quiz was made using Javascript and branching concepts to display different results based on user input. 

Math Logic: 
If the sum of all the users answers is 10, this means the person has said No to everything which will prompt the user with the fourth answer asking them to pick any where to expand their options and will display each of the previous options. 

The most you can get if you answer Yes to everything will be 5, so getting this exact number will pull up visiting Japan. 

I have then split the logic for the last two options. 
	⁃	If the sum is =< 8 I will be recommending Morocco
	⁃	If the sum is > 8 I will be recommending Denmark

Setup/Installation Requirements
	•	You need a web browser, and you can open the HTML file in the main folder to see the page running.
